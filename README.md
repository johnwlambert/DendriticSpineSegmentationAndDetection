# DendriticSpineSegmentationAndDetection

This repository consists of three code-bases:

1. Fully Convolutional Network implementation in TensorFlow

2. Implementation of Sliding-Window RPN and SVM Classifier for Bounding Box Detection

3. MATLAB Code to Generate Ground-Truth Semantic Image Segmentation Pixel Labels

4. IPython Notebook code to extract positive and negative examples of dendriti spines, and save them as 36x36 pixel jpg files. We feed those .jpg files into the SVM
